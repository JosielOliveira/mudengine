Q. Do I need to check prereq at each turn?
R. Yes, because the actor can consume the resources with other action,
he can move away from the place, he can issue a lengthly action and just run.

Simple actions needs to be, in essence, short-lived actions.

For long-lived, all actions became Continuous.
The prerequisite is checked each turn and the action is cancelled if this check fails at any moment.
If the prerequisite fails before endTurn (or even AT endTurn), no effect is triggered.
